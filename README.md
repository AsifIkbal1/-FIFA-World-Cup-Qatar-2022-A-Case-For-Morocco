# FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022: A Case For Morocco
---
Despite the [controversies](https://nypost.com/2022/11/15/all-the-controversies-surrounding-the-qatar-world-cup-in-2022/) surrounding this World Cup, Qatar 2022 has given us so many memorable events. The Iranian team not singing the national anthem paying homage to women’s rights in Iran, the giant killing of Morocco, Argentina’s defeat by Saudi Arabia, Japan’s win against the 4-time winners Germany, Uruguay’s karma vs Ghana and so many more. This World Cup has also seen first-timers and new records being set. Qatar became the first host nation to lose its opening game; so was Brazil's defeat to Cameroon (they have never lost to an African team before), Morocco became the first African nation to advance to a world cup semi-final, Cristiano Ronaldo became the first male player to score at 5 World Cup, first all-female refereeing team at a men’s FIFA World Cup game, first time countries from all continents qualified for the knockout stage and so on [[7](https://nypost.com/2022/11/15/all-the-controversies-surrounding-the-qatar-world-cup-in-2022/),

. 

So in this notebook I will try to explore the Qatar FIFA World Cup 2022 games dataset highlighting the key features/attributes of teams.  In addition to the obvious stats that contributes to a team's success I will try to see if there are hidden game attributes which can be important to success in an attempt to make a case for **Morocco** , the surprise team of the tournament,  whenever possible.
