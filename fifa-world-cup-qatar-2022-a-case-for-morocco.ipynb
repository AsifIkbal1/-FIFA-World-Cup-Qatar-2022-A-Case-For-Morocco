The Iranian team not singing the national anthem paying homage to women’s rights in Iran, the giant killing of Morocco, Argentina’s defeat by Saudi Arabia, Japan’s win against the 4-time winners Germany, Uruguay’s karma vs Ghana and so many more. This World Cup has also seen first-timers and new records being set. Qatar became the first host nation to lose its opening game; so was Brazil's defeat to Cameroon (they have never lost to an African team before), Morocco became the first African nation to advance to a world cup semi-final, Cristiano Ronaldo became the first male player to score at 5 World Cup, first all-female refereeing team at a men’s FIFA World Cup game, first time countries from all continents qualified for the knockout stage and so on [[7](https://nypost.com/2022/11/15/all-the-controversies-surrounding-the-qatar-world-cup-in-2022/),\n[8](https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/Key-unforgettable-moments-of-2022-World-Cup-Group-stage-in-Qatar-1673927),\n[9](https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/ronaldo-1st-male-player-score-5-world-cups-93923484),\n[11](https://www.timeoutdoha.com/sport-wellbeing/records-broken-qatar-2022)]\n. \n\nSo in this notebook I will try to explore the Qatar FIFA World Cup 2022 games dataset highlighting the key features/attributes of teams.  In addition to the obvious stats that contributes to a team's success I will try to see if there are hidden game attributes which can be important to success in an attempt to make a case for **Morocco** , the surprise team of the tournament,  whenever possible.

However, goals do not come out of the blue; teams need to work on a strategy, players need to have the talent and composure or need to be resilient working under pressure and of course there is also luck. Among other things xG’s (expected goals), shots (on target), ball possession and effective ball could give us a good indication if a goal is about to happen or not. Here I will try to explore a few of these game attributes.\n\n\n### Goals and xG's\n\nExpected goals (xG) calculates how many goals a team should have scored based on the quality of the chances created. It is a more accurate and fairer assessment than shots on targets [[2](https://footballxg.com/)].\n\nIn an ideal scenario xG is equal to goals, teams/players score the chances they are expected to convert. However, we do not live in an ideal world and that doesn't happen all the time. Higher xG's than scored goals implies wastefulness. The opposite however may suggest that teams/players were more prolific than expected. Of course (as always) there are exceptions to this assumption such as expected errors, extraordinary defense/goalkeeping, a genius of a strike etc.\n\nWe observe the following from the data.\n\n- Germany has the highest xG with 3.35 per game. But the could only convert 2 of them. Meaning they were the most wasetfull of the teams. If you don't score the chance you are expected to score, probabily you don't win aginst you are expected either. Remember Japan vs Germany?\n- Of all the teams below the dotted line (higher xG than goals) only Brazil made it out of the group stage. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"team_data['goal_per_game'] = team_data['goals']/team_data['games']\nteam_data['xg_per_game'] = team_data['xg']/team_data['games']\nteam_data['npxg_per_game'] = team_data['npxg']/team_data['games']\n\n\nfig = px.scatter(team_data,\n                 y='goal_per_game',\n                 x='xg_per_game',\n                 color='team',\n                 size='goal_per_game',\n                 width=850,\n                 height=500,\n                 text=team_data['team'],)\n\nfig.add_shape( \n    type=\"line\", line_color=\"black\", line_width=0.5, opacity=1, line_dash=\"dot\",\n    y0=0, y1=1, yref=\"paper\", x0=0, x1=1, xref=\"paper\", \n)\nfig.update_layout(showlegend=False, title='<b> Goals vs xG (expected goals) <b>', template='ggplot2',titlefont={'size':24})\nfig.show()\n\nfig = px.scatter(team_data,\n                 y='goal_per_game',\n                 x='npxg_per_game',\n                 color='team',\n                 size='goal_per_game',\n                 width=850,\n                 height=500,\n                 text=team_data['team'],)\n\nfig.add_shape( \n    type=\"line\", line_color=\"black\", line_width=0.5, opacity=1, line_dash=\"dot\",\n    y0=0, y1=1, yref=\"paper\", x0=0, x1=1, xref=\"paper\", \n)\nfig.update_layout(showlegend=False, title='<b> Goals vs npxG (non-penality expected goals) <b>', template='ggplot2', titlefont={'size':24})\nfig.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-28T11:59:22.498911Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-28T11:59:22.499343Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-28T11:59:22.956603Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-28T11:59:22.499302Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-28T11:59:22.955551Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Shots on Target\n\nOpta [[3]](https://www.statsperform.com/opta-event-definitions/) defines shots on target as follows:\n\n> A shot on target is defined as any goal attempt that:\n> \n> - Goes into the net regardless of intent – For Goals only.\n> - Is a clear attempt to score that would have gone into the net but for being saved by the goalkeeper or is stopped by a player who is the last-man with the goalkeeper having no chance of preventing the goal (last line block).\n> \n> Shots directly hitting the frame of the goal are not counted as shots on target, unless the ball goes in and is awarded as a goal.Shots blocked by another player, who is not the last-man, are not counted as shots on target.\n\n**Observations**:\n- The most notable observation is that **Germany** under-performed in this tournament.

Passes include open play passes, goal kicks, corners and free kicks played as pass – but exclude crosses, keeper throws and throw-ins.\n- **Progressive pass:** A forward pass that attempts to advance a team significantly closer to the opponent’s goal [[10](https://dataglossary.wyscout.com/progressive_pass/)].\n- **Bribbles:** An attempt by a player to beat an opponent when they have possession of the ball. A successful dribble means the player beats the defender while retaining possession, unsuccessful ones are where the dribbler is tackled.\n\n**Observations**:\n\nFor fair comparison we'll consider the per-game stats here.\n\n- Spain had by far the most average ball possession (75.8%), a 13 percent more possession than the second placed team England.\n- Spain is also a pass master.

However, if we look closely Argentina deviates from the rest, i.e they seem to have made more short passes resulting in an overall distance a little less proportional to the total passes they have completed. Being the play-maker of his team, it is likely that he [Messi] is involved in most of the passes Argentina makes.
